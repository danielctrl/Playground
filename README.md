# Objective 

The ideia of this project is to help people who is trying anything in DotNet at scale using Docker Swarm in your own machine. It might be helpful when trying to test a connection's limit or when performing a load test. 

As stated before, it must run in your own machine with a minimal simple setup, so you can expect for optimization such as limiting the resource usage of each containers and so on...

It's a premise that everything used must be free and very easy to setup and use.
